One of the problematic issues in writing cross-SQL code is an API that differs from
one SQL to another.

There are two open source libraries that provide unified API

1. [soci](http://soci.sourceforge.net) -- C++ library.
2. [dbi](http://libdbi.sourceforge.net) -- C library.

At the first point I had chosen soci as native solution of C++ programmer. After running some benchmarks on the new version of this blog I had found [20% performance](http://art-blog.no-ip.info/cppcms/blog/post/11) reduction for MySQL
database. But I also remembered that there should be [negligible difference](http://art-blog.no-ip.info/cppcms/blog/post/8) between MySQL and Berkeley DB.
This was mostly due to incorrect design of my BDB database layout I had done.

That had seem to be strange and I stared benchmarking the system more and more.
